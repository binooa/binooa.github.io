                  consideration the following decision has been taken:<br>
                  “In the change brought about in the dress rules, there appears 
                  to be some confusion in so far as the sub courts are 
                  concerned. For removal of any doubt it is clarified that so 
                  far as the courts other than Supreme Court and High Courts are 
                  concerned during summer while wearing black coat is not 
                  mandatory, the advocates may appear in white shirt with black 
                  or striped or grey pant with black tie or band and collar”.
