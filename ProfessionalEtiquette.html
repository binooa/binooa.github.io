                  <b>PREAMBLE </b><br>
                  An advocate shall, at all times, comport, himself in a manner 
                  befitting his status as an officer of the Court, a privileged 
                  member of the community, and a gentleman, bearing in mind that 
                  what may be lawful and moral for a person who is not a member 
                  of the Bar, or for a member of the Bar in his non-professional 
                  capacity may still be improper for an Advocate. Without 
                  prejudice to the generality of the foregoing obligation, an 
                  Advocate shall fearlessly uphold the interests of his client 
                  and in his conduct conform to the rules hereinafter mentioned 
                  both in letter and in spirit. The rules hereafter mentioned 
                  contain canons of conduct and etiquette adopted as general 
                  guides: yet the specific mention thereof shall be constructed 
                  as a denial of the existence of other equally imperative 
                  though not specifically mentioned. <br>

                  case and while otherwise acting before a Court, conduct 
                  himself with dignity and self-respect. He shall not be servile 
                  and whenever there is proper ground for serious complaint 
                  against a judicial officer, it shall be his right and duty to

                  is a member of the Executive Committee of such organization or 
                  institution or society or corporation.” Executive Committee”, 
                  by whatever name it may be called, shall include any Committee 
                  or body of person which, for the time being, is vested with 
                  the general management of the affairs of the organization or 
                  institution, society or corporation: <br>
                  Provided that this rule shall not apply to such a member 
                  appearing as “amicus curiae” or without a fee in a matter 
                  affecting the affairs of a Bar Council, incorporated law

                  <font color="#FF0000"><b>SECTION - 2 DUTY TO THE CLIENT </b>
                  </font><br>
                  <b>11</b>. An advocate is bound to accept any brief in the 
                  Courts or Tribunals or before any other authority in or before 
                  which he profess to practice at a fee consistent with his 
                  standing at the Bar and the nature of the case. Special 
                  circumstances may justify his refusal to accept a particular 
                  brief. <br>
                  <b>12</b>. An Advocate shall not ordinarily withdraw from

                  fees as has not been earned. <br>
                  <b>13</b>. An Advocate should not accept a brief or appear in 
                  a case in which he has reason to believe that he will be a 
                  witness and if being engaged in a case, it becomes apparent 
                  that he is a witness on a material question of fact, he should 
                  not continue to appear as an Advocate if he can retire without 
                  jeopardising his client’s interest. <br>
                  <b>14.</b> An Advocate shall at the commencement of his 
                  engagement and during the continuance thereof, make all such 
                  full and fraud disclosures to his client relating to his 
                  connection with the parties and any interest in or about the 
                  controversy as are likely to affect his client’s judgement in 
                  either engaging him or continue the engagement. <br>
                  <b>15</b>. It shall be the duty of an Advocate fearlessly to

                  or any other. He shall defend a person accused of a crime 
                  regardless of his personal opinion as to the guilt of the 
                  accuse, bearing in mind that his loyalty is to the law which 
                  requires that no man should be convicted without adequate 
                  evidence. <br>
                  <b>16</b>. An Advocate appearing for the prosecution in a 
                  criminal trial shall so conduct the prosecution that it does 
                  not lead to conviction of the innocent. The suppression of 
                  material capable of establishing the innocence of the accused

                  contingent on the results of litigation or agree to share the

                  <b>21</b>. An Advocate shall not buy or traffic in or 
                  stipulate for or agree to receive any share or interest in any 
                  actionable claim. Nothing in this Rule shall apply to stock, 
                  shares and debentures or government securities, or to any 
                  instruments which are, for the time being, by law or custom 
                  negotiable or to any mercantile document of title to goods.

                  for or purchase either in his own name or in any other name, 
                  for his own benefit or for the benefit of any other person, 
                  any property sold in the execution of a decree or order in any 
                  suit, appeal or other proceeding in which he was in any way 
                  professionally engaged. This prohibition, however, does not 
                  prevent an Advocate from bidding for or purchasing for his 
                  client any <br>
                  property which his client may himself legally bid for or 
                  purchase, provided the Advocate is expressly authorised in 
                  writing in this behalf. <br>
                  <b>23</b>. An Advocate shall not adjust fee payable to him by 
                  his client against his own personal liability to the client, 
                  which liability does not arise in the course of his employment 
                  as an Advocate. <br>
                  <b>24</b>. An Advocate shall not do anything whereby he abuses 
                  or takes advantage of the confidence reposed in him by his 
                  client <br>
                  <b>25</b>. An Advocate should keep accounts of the client’s 
                  money entrusted to him, and the accounts should show the 
                  amounts received from the client or on his behalf, the 
                  expenses incurred for him and the debits made on account of 
                  fees with respective dates and all other necessary 
                  particulars. <br>
                  <b>26</b>. Where moneys are received from or on account of a 
                  client, the entries in the accounts should contain a reference 
                  as to whether the amounts have been received for fees or 
                  expenses, and during the course of the proceedings, no 
                  Advocate shall, except with the consent in writing of the 
                  client concerned, be at liberty to divert any portion of the 
                  expenses towards fees. </font>

                  result of the litigation or agree to share the proceeds 
                  thereof and that he shall not stipulate for or agree to 
                  receive any share or interest in any actionable claim. (Xavier

                  intimated to the client as early as possible. <br>
                  <b>28</b>. After the termination of the proceeding the
